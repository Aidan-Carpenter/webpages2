    <p>My name is Aidan Carpenter. I am an intended <em>construction engineer</em> and I am a freshman of the class of 2027. I chose construction engineering because I want to try and reduce the population of people experiencing homelessness through sustainable and affordable housing. I want to start in the field and work there for a good amount of time; then I'll become a project manager and work for a non-profit organization in developing nations for a few years.</p> 
	<br />
	<p style="color:#FFFFFF;font-size:16px;font-family:Times;text-align:center">The job I last worked at was a place called <ins>Teen Valley Ranch</ins>. <strong>TVR</strong> is a non-denominational christian camp where I worked as a volunteer for eight weeks doing groundskeeping work and counceling. I have worked there for the past three summers and would work there again this comming summer if I got paid. Right now I am looking for an internship in construction.
